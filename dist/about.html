              Have you ever had a dream of accomplishing more? It's something I
              carry on as my goal throughout my life. A little girl whose story
              begins in a wonderful east European country had to pick her major
              at the age of 16. I mean, what do you really can know at 16 years
              old? Definitely not what you want to do, and where you want to
              work for the rest of your life. The only thing I knew by then is
              that I need to start somewhere. So I did, picked economy as my
              major, and started to explore this world.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              My journey has always been fun, and I traveled a bit around the
              world during my college years, and end up living in Warszaw by
              myself when I turned 20. By then I knew that I can easily
              understand people around me, help them, and manage to find any
              solution I need. That's how I picked my Mastersâ€™s degree major -
              International relations, something that sounded really cool and
              remotely related to what I thought I wanted to do.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Path with ups and downs brought me to the USA a year later. Here
              is where the real journey begins. I started working in hospitality
              and that was something that helped me to realize how much
              attention paid to understand and satisfy customers. That was like
              a whole other world! I really learned to work hard and to listen
              to people, that was a key to empathizing and understanding them.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              "But how all that is related to what are you doing in UX world?" -
              You will ask me. My answer will be - Easy. With all my experience
              of working, studying, and knowing people, one thing finally came
              clear - I really enjoy working with people and for people,
              analyzing, defining, and creating for a better tomorrow. Finding
              myself in UX/UI design has been quite a journey that helped me to
              become an empathetic, thoughtful, and solution-oriented designer.
